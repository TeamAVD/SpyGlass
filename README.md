### Introduction
Welcome to SpyGlass, a decentralised social media app for Android. The goal of this project is to be lightweight, free to develop, User friendly and highly customisable.

### How It Works
The interface is written in HTML and CSS while the function side of things is written in JS and JSON. Google Drive is used as a sort of back-end to store messages and media. Users are able to send simulated real-time messages using a polling method. There's basically a delay as the sent and received messages have to be read from Google Drive.
The app is a simple WebView APK that loads the files hosted on the GitHub pages site of this repository.

### How To Set It Up
1. Download the universal WebView APK from [here](https://google.com/404) or from the [releases section](https://google.com/404).
2. Install the file and open it.
3. Follow the instructions on-screen.

You should be all set up!

### Features
• Posts (text, image, video, audio): Users can view each other's posts as well as create and upload Their own.
• Direct & group messaging / calls: Users can send messages to each other directly or in groups. This includes voice notes and media such as images, GIF's, videos and audio. Voice calls are also supported.
• Stories: Users can upload media which can be publicly viewed as a story.
• Profile management: Users can edit Their handle, username, gender, age, D.O.B, sexuality, profile picture, profile banner and occupation.
• Settings: Privacy, Security, Account, Profile, Theming, Media, etc.

**Possible future features:**
• Live: Users will be able to create or watch live streams. This could include a gifting / levelling system, similar to TikTok.
• Shorts feed: A feed consistent of short-form videos that support likes, dislikes, comments, following the Creator, reposting, sharing and reporting.
• Premium: A cheap subscription that offers perks such as hidden typing status, hiding online status, hide message read receipts, a premium badge on Users profiles, extended custom themes, plugins access and more.

### Notes
• As the project is being developed entirely in HTML, CSS, JS and JSON, it's quite limited. It's possible that other languages may need to be utilised to implement new features in the future.
• While the project is aimed towards Android Users, it could definitely be used by IOS Users as WebView is being utilised.
